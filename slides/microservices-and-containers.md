### Microservices and Containers


#### Microservices and Containers
* Container serves as the  _unit_ equivalent of microservice
* Deployable artefact (i.e. _image_)
* Can be versioned
* Layered filesystem
   + Deploying updates equivalent of deploying _just what was changed_
Note: containers mitigate some of the above issues


#### Managing Microservice Containers
* Still quite a lot of work maintaining large applications
* Monitoring health of many services difficult
* Maintain homeostasis 
   + constant number of _healthy_ services
   + scale in proportion to demand
Note: Containers solve part of the problem
